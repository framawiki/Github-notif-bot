[IMPR] NewUsersEntry class retrieves User object for page() method

- Derive NewUsersEntry from UserTargetLogEntry which returns a User class
  for page() method
- Do nit inherit page method in UserTargetLogEntry. Otherwise instantiating
  the User object may fail in NewUsersEntry
  (and later in BlockEntry with next patch)
- It is no longer necessary to change the class in welcome.py
- Update tests to check User class (T5564)
