[bugfix] illustratewikidata: rename page_image key in page_image_free

The name of the key is no longer page_image but is now page_image_free.
So illustrate_wikidata.py is actually entirely broken.
Note: I don't think that we need, with this script, to get non-free images too. So I'll just implement the rename, not the both elements key.
